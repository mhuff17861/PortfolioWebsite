base.html
------------

    This is a base html file that can be used by templates which connects
    to bootsrap and any other necessary site-wide css, while creating a navigation bar
    and footer.

    The head-add block can be used to add things to the html head.

    The title block can be used to add a page title. Default is "Micah Huff's Site."

    The main-content block can be used to add content to the center of the page, between the
    navigation and the footer
